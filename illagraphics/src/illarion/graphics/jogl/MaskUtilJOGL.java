/**
 * This is the JOGL implementation for the mask utility that can be used to
 * limit the render area in non-rectangle ways.
 * <p>
 * Drawing a mask basically works this way that you first start drawing a mask
 * and use the Drawer utility then to draw the shapes of the mask. After this is
 * done you finish the mask and then you are able to select if you want to draw
 * anything ON the mask or outside the mask. After you are done with all
 * operations that need the mask you just discard the mask again so the render
 * are acts normally again.
 * </p>
 * Note that drawing a mask takes about the same time as drawing shapes into the
 * color buffer.
